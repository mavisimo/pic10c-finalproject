# pic10c-finalproject
Final project for PIC10C

### Progress Documentation:
* **05/04/2020**: project proposal, see below 

### Proposal:
Currently choosing between:
1. **highway traffic simulation** - more challenging because I am unfamiliar on how to real-time present/animate this; plan to use random variables/user input for number of lanes, car speed/size, lane changes and highway exists/entrances
2. **nonogram game** - I'm a big fan of nonograms and thought it would be fun to recreate the puzzle game myself first starting with random generated blocks and proceeding to scanning input image files to create a personalized nonogram; see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) for an explanation of nonograms
